-- 0054_group_scoring_rebalance.sql
--
-- Rebalances group-stage scoring to its final values, superseding scoring v4
-- (0051). Per group, the predicted top 2 vs the actual top 2 score:
--   exact pair      = 10  (15 for Group I "Group of Death")
--   reversed pair   = 7
--   single team in its correct slot = 5
--   single team in the wrong slot   = 2   (v4 zeroed this; now a consolation)
--   nothing correct = 0
-- Max group total = 11×10 + 15 = 125 (all-exact, Group I premium).
--
-- The wrong-slot award fires only inside the else branch (group not exact, not
-- reversed). There at most one of the two picks can be in the actual top 2, so
-- the ordered CASE returns 5 (correct slot), else 2 (wrong slot), else 0 —
-- mutually exclusive, no double counting.
--
-- The group_scores CTE is inlined in both get_leaderboard and
-- get_leaderboard_rank, so both are re-emitted from 0051 with only that CTE's
-- group CASE changed. admin_get_leaderboard (0042) wraps get_leaderboard, so it
-- inherits the change.
