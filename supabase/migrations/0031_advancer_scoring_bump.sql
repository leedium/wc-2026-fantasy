-- Advancers v2.1: bump set-membership weight.
--
-- Old weights (0028): +0.25 set, +0.25 rank → max 4 advancer points.
-- New weights:        +1.00 set, +0.25 rank → max 10 advancer points.
--
-- Per advancer pick:
--   * team in the actual top-8 AND at the same rank → 1.25 (1 + 0.25)
--   * team in the actual top-8 (any rank)           → 1.00
--   * else                                          → 0
--
-- New leaderboard max: 74 (groups) + 10 (advancers) + 200 (knockout) = 284.
