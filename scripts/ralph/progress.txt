## Codebase Patterns
- Frontend located at `/frontend` directory
- Run quality checks from frontend dir: `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`
- TypeScript strict mode enabled in tsconfig.json
- Next.js App Router in `src/app/` directory
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

## 2026-01-21 - US-001
- What was implemented: Verified Next.js 16.1.4 project with App Router, TypeScript strict mode. Added typecheck script to package.json.
- Files changed: `frontend/package.json` (added typecheck script)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Project already had Next.js initialized via create-next-app
  - Next.js 16.1.4 is installed (exceeds the 15 requirement in PRD)
  - Tailwind CSS 4 is already configured (via @tailwindcss/postcss)
  - There's a warning about workspace root detection due to multiple lockfiles - can be fixed via turbopack.root config if needed
